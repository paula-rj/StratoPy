Stratopy Documentation
======================


**Stratopy** consists of three types of modules, based on the ETL design:
The Extractors, the transformers and the Loaders.
Besides, we include a datasets module, that contains data needed to perform 
some transformations, and some other util modules.
The available modules and documentation are listed below.
